Tic Tac Toe AI README

Introduction:
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe AI project! This project aims to implement a simple yet effective Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm. This README will guide you through the setup, usage, and implementation details of the project.
Implementation Details:

The game is implemented in Python.
The board is represented as a 3x3 list where empty cells are represented by ' '.
The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves.
The minimax() function recursively evaluates all possible moves to determine the best move for the AI.
